# AlienInvasion
Hi! 
I'm Ella, a girl who is 12 years old. You can also call me "九亿（jiuyi）".
I come from China and my English is not very well. So if I have some Grammar error...Tell me please! I want to practice my English!
I am a busy girl because I will go to middle school soon, so I don't have enough time to update my code and this web... Thanks for your understanding!

This item is my first item--AlienInvasion!
I read 《Python Crash Course》 and found it, it's a funny game that made by Pygame (a module in Python).
It include 6 big part (class):
1.Main code
2.Settings (save all the attribute)
3.Ship
4.Alien
5.Bullet
6.Action (shooting, Delete the aliens from the screen and so on~)
In each big part,it all has some small part, I won't elaborate here.

As a student,I'm very busy now, so I don't know when this web can be update...
You can contact me in this following ways:
